									<p>At CrossCredit, I contributed significantly to a project aimed at optimizing
										credit offerings through an in-depth analysis of customer behaviour and credit
										utilization patterns. Utilizing Microsoft Power BI, our team explored key metrics 
										such as customer attrition rates, gender distribution, card types held by long-tenured

										identify those with the highest attrition, assessed the impact of dependents on spending
										behaviour, and analyzed the effects of revolving balances on customer activity.
										Additionally, we evaluted transaction volumes, average credit limits, customer assistance
										frequency, and utilization ratios. Our comprehensive analysis yielded actionable insights
										that enhanced customer satisfaction, streamlined operations, and supported growth. By
										developing strategic recommendations, we significantly improved credit approval processes
										and customer rentention, highlighting the power of data-driven approaches in the financial
										sectors.
