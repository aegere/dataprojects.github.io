									<h2><a href="#">Sunshine Resort Customer Analysis</a></h2>
									<p>As a Business Analyst working with Sunshine Resort, I spearheaded a comprehensive data 
										analysis intiative aimed at optimizing guest satisfaction and revenue generation. Our 
										Project stood out for its diverse clientele, attracting guests from various parts of the 
										world, including Europe, North America, and South Africa. Leveraging sophisticated analysis techniques in Microsoft Excel, we meticulously examined reservation 
										data encompassing bookings, cancellations, customer preferences, and revenue streams. Through
										detailed analysis and visualization, we uncovered a notable churn rate among these customers.
										These insights were pivotal in guiding strategic decision-making within the resort. Collaborating
										closely with our team, we tailored interventions that led to a commendable 10% decreaase in the 
										resort's churn rate. This experience not only showcased our proficiency in leveraging data-driven 
										methodologies but also highlighted the effectiveness of Microsoft Excel as a tool for analysis
										and visualization in the hospitality sector.
